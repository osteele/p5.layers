# p5.js Libraries

This project contains libraries for [p5.js](https://p5js.org).

p5.layers simplifies some common use cases for [p5.js
Graphics](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createGraphics) objects. It makes it
easier to use Graphics objects to implement drawing layers, and it removes the
need to add or subtract the `g.` prefix to draw calls in order to change them
between drawing on the canvas, and drawing on a Graphics.
