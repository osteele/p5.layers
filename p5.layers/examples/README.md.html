<h2 id="trail"><a href="./trail/">trail</a></h2>
<p>A common trick is to call <code>background()</code> with a non-full opacity argument, in
order to leave a trail. This works when everything on the canvas should leave a
trail. How about when only some objects should leave a trail?</p>
<p>One solution is to use an Array, in order to re-draw all the elements of the
trail each time the canvas is erased. (<a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1031294">This
example</a> demonstrates this
technique.) Another is to draw the object that leaves a trail in its own layer.
That&#39;s what this example does. (<a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1031301">This
example</a> demonstrates the same
technique without the p5.layer library.)</p>
<h2 id="lissajous"><a href="./lissajous/">lissajous</a></h2>
<p>Another example of using a Graphics in order for one object to allow one
object to leave a trail, while the rest of the canvas is fully erased.</p>
<h2 id="slices"><a href="./slices/">slices</a></h2>
<p>Using two layers in order to slice an sketch into two rectangles, that can be
moved independently.</p>
<h2 id="creategraphics"><a href="./createGraphics/">createGraphics</a></h2>
<p>In this example, <code>enterLayer()</code> is only used to temporarily replace the p5.js
graphics commands. The sketch itself is responsible for creating and drawing the
Graphics.</p>
<h2 id="adjacent-layers"><a href="./adjacent-layers/">adjacent-layers</a></h2>
<p>Call <code>enterLayer()</code> with two different keys, in order to create two Graphics
that are drawn side by side.</p>
