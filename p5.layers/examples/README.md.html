<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
<p>These sketches are examples for the <a href="https://osteele.github.io/p5.libs/p5.layers/">p5.layers</a> p5.js library.</p>
<p>This library extend the p5.js functions to accept Vector arguments, so that you
can write e.g. <code>circle(c, 10)</code> instead of <code>circle(c.x, c.y, 10)</code> (<code>c</code> is a
variable whose value is an instance of p5.Vector).</p>
<p>The directory can be opened via <a href="https://osteele.github.io/p5-server/"><code>p5 server</code></a> (which knows how to run
JavaScript-only sketches, and recognizes to include the <code>p5.layers</code>
library in these sketches); or it can be browsed on the web at
<a href="https://osteele.github.io/p5.libs/p5.layers/examples/">https://osteele.github.io/p5.libs/p5.layers/examples/</a>. The web
version was created by the <code>p5 build</code> subcommand of <code>p5 server</code>.</p>

<h3 id="trail"><a href="./trail/">trail</a></h3>
<p>A common trick is to call <code>background()</code> with a non-full opacity argument, in
order to leave a trail. This works when everything on the canvas should leave a
trail. How about when only some objects should leave a trail?</p>
<p>One solution is to use an Array, in order to re-draw all the elements of the
trail each time the canvas is erased. (<a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1031294">This
example</a> demonstrates this
technique.) Another is to draw the object that leaves a trail in its own layer.
That&#39;s what this example does. (<a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1031301">This
example</a> demonstrates the same
technique without the p5.layer library.)</p>
<h3 id="lissajous"><a href="./lissajous/">lissajous</a></h3>
<p>Another example of using a Graphics in order for one object to allow one
object to leave a trail, while the rest of the canvas is fully erased.</p>
<h3 id="slices"><a href="./slices/">slices</a></h3>
<p>Using two layers in order to slice an sketch into two rectangles, that can be
moved independently.</p>
<h3 id="creategraphics"><a href="./createGraphics/">createGraphics</a></h3>
<p>In this example, <code>enterLayer()</code> is only used to temporarily replace the p5.js
graphics commands. The sketch itself is responsible for creating and drawing the
Graphics.</p>
<h3 id="adjacent-layers"><a href="./adjacent-layers/">adjacent-layers</a></h3>
<p>Call <code>enterLayer()</code> with two different keys, in order to create two Graphics
that are drawn side by side.</p>
