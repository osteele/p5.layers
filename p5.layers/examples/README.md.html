<p>These sketches are examples for the
<a href="https://osteele.github.io/p5.libs/p5.layers/">p5.layers</a> library. They
demonstrate some effects that can be achieved by using instances of p5.Graphics,
and techniques for using the p5.layers library to do so.</p>

<h3 id="trail">trail</h3>
<p>A common trick in creative coding is to call <code>background()</code> with a non-full
opacity argument. This causes moving objects to leave a trail. This trick works
when <em>everything</em> that is drawn on the canvas should leave a trail. How about
when only <em>some</em> objects should leave a trail?</p>
<p>One solution is to use an Array, in order to re-draw all the elements of the
trail each time the canvas is erased. (<a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1031294">This
example</a> demonstrates this
technique.)</p>
<p>Another is to draw the object that leaves a trail in its own layer. That&#39;s what
the example in this directory does. (<a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1031301">This
example</a> demonstrates how to use this
technique without uisng the p5.layer library.)</p>

<p>Another example of using a Graphics in order for one object to allow one
object to leave a trail, while the rest of the canvas is fully erased.</p>
<h3 id="slices">slices</h3>
<p>Using two layers in order to slice a sketch into two rectangles. These
rectangles can then be moved independently around the canvas.</p>
<h3 id="creategraphics">createGraphics</h3>
<p>In this example, <code>enterLayer()</code> is only used to temporarily replace the p5.js
graphics commands. The sketch itself is responsible for creating and drawing the
Graphics.</p>
<h3 id="adjacent-layers">adjacent-layers</h3>
<p>Call <code>enterLayer()</code> with two different keys, in order to create two Graphics
that are drawn side by side.</p>

<p>The directory can be opened via <a href="https://osteele.github.io/p5-server/"><code>p5 server</code></a>. This command knows how to run
JavaScript-only sketches, and recognizes that the sketches in this directory
depend on the <code>p5.vector-arguments</code> library in these sketches.</p>
<p>Or, it can be browsed on the web at
<a href="https://osteele.github.io/p5.libs/p5.vector-arguments/examples/">https://osteele.github.io/p5.libs/p5.vector-arguments/examples/</a>.</p>
<p>The web version was created by the <code>p5 build</code> subcommand of <code>p5 server</code>.</p>
